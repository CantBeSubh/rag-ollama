# RagOllama - Adaptive RAG Chatbot
This Adaptive RAG Agent webapp will uses LLM to answer questions about a PDF document. The app uses a graph-based approach to answer questions. The graph is built using LangGraph. 

The RAG technique is used is called Adaptive RAG. Why is this called Adaptive?
1. Routing: Route questions to different retrieval approaches
2. Fallback:  Fallback to web search if docs are not relevant to query
3. Self-correction: Fix answers w/ hallucinations or donâ€™t address question
